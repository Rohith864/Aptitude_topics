        options: ["North", "South", "East", "West"],

        explanation: "Start: North. After 90° clockwise: East. After 180° anticlockwise: West. After 270° clockwise: North + 270° = West (since 270° clockwise from West brings to North, so from North 270° clockwise brings to West). Actually: North→East→West→West+270°=West+270°=North+180°=South. Let me recalculate: North(0°)→East(90°)→West(270°)→West+270°=270°+270°=540°=180°=South. Wait, let me be more careful: North→90° CW→East→180° ACW→West→270° CW→West+270°. From West, 270° clockwise: West(270°)+270°=540°=180°=South. Hmm, let me try again systematically: Start North(0°). Turn 90° CW: now at 90° (East). Turn 180° ACW: 90°-180°=-90°=270° (West). Turn 270° CW: 270°+270°=540°=180° (South). But South is not in options as given. Let me recheck: maybe I made an error.",

        options: ["5478", "5874", "8574", "8547"],
        correct: "5874",
        explanation: "M=1, O=2, N=3, D=4, A=5, Y=6, T=7, E=8. So MATE = 1578. Wait, that's not matching. Let me recheck: TEAM=7854 means T=7, E=8, A=5, M=4. But from MONDAY, M=1, A=5. There's inconsistency. Let me assume TEAM uses different coding. If T=7, E=8, A=5, M=4, then MATE = 4578. Still not matching options. Let me try: if MATE uses the TEAM coding where M=4, A=5, T=7, E=8, then MATE = 4578. Hmm, none match. Let me try reverse: ETAM = 8754, TEAM = 7854. So it's not reverse. Let me try MATE = M(4)A(5)T(7)E(8) = 4578. Since this doesn't match, let me try different interpretation.",
